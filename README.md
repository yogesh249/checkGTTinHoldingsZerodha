# checkGTTinHoldingsZerodha
This script will check if the GTT order placed is present in Holdings or not. If present it will add a suitcase to the stock name. This will work only on zerodha GTT screen

1. Install scripty extension from https://scripty.abhisheksatre.com/#/store
2. Find validateGTT extension

   That is all you need to do. if you still see its not working, just refresh the page by pressing F5. (As the javascript executes on page load and perhaps when we click GTT tab the whole page is not reloaded)
